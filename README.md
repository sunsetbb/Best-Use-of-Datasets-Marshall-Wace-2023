# Best-Use-of-Datasets-Marshall-Wace-2023


This year, we are focusing on the power of data and how it can be harnessed to create innovative solutions. Your challenge is to develop a unique, scalable, and reliable data pipeline that retrieves a dataset of your choice and makes the best use of it.

You are free to choose any dataset that you find interesting. Your task is to implement a data pipeline to scrape or retrieve this dataset, and then create a solution that utilizes this data to its fullest potential. Your solution could be a new application, a data analysis tool, a predictive model, or any other innovative idea that leverages the dataset.

Evaluation Criteria:
Reliability — Your data pipeline should be robust and reliable. It should handle errors gracefully and account for missing data.
Uniqueness — We are looking for solutions that address unique problems or needs. Consider how saturated the market is for your solution and whether the data you are using is particularly interesting or unique.
Scalability — Your data pipeline should be scalable. Consider how it could be implemented at an industry scale and what future developments could be made.
Visualization — Your solution should include a way to visualize and monitor the data. This could be through a dashboard, graphs, charts, or any other visual representation of the data.
Pipeline Design — Your data pipeline should be well-designed. It should be modular and reproducible, allowing for easy updates and modifications in the future.

We encourage you to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions that make the best use of the dataset.

We are running a workshop on data pipelines at 13:00 and encourage you to use what you learned in the workshop in your application.

Good luck!

Goal: Encourage creativity, innovation, design, planning, diversity of thought etc
